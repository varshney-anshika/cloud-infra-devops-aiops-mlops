# Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring & Automation with AIOps/MLOps

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a cloud infrastructure using **Terraform**, automated deployment using **CI/CD pipelines**, and the integration of **AIOps** for intelligent monitoring and **MLOps** for continuous model deployment. It aims to showcase best practices in cloud infrastructure management, application deployment, and machine learning model operations.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varshney-anshika/cloud-infra-monitoring-aiops-mlops.git
   cd cloud-infra-monitoring-aiops-mlops
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Ensure your AWS credentials are set up. You can configure them using:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:**
   Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

4. **Deploy Applications and Models:**
   Follow the instructions in the CI/CD pipeline section to automate the deployment of applications and machine learning models.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. It includes:
- `cicd.yml`: Automates the deployment of infrastructure and applications.
- `mlops.yml`: Automates the training and deployment of machine learning models.

## AIOps Integration
The project integrates AIOps practices by:
- Using **Prometheus** for monitoring application performance and infrastructure metrics.
- Implementing **Moogsoft/BigPanda** for anomaly detection and intelligent incident management.

## MLOps Pipeline
The MLOps pipeline automates the lifecycle of machine learning models:
- **Training**: Automatically retrains models based on new data.
- **Deployment**: Deploys trained models as microservices in Kubernetes.

## Monitoring and Alerts
Set up alerts using **Grafana** and integrate with AIOps tools to notify stakeholders of any anomalies detected in the system.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
